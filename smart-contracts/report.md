# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

	```

</details>



## L-2: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.28;
	```

</details>



## L-3: PUSH0 Opcode

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

	pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

</details>



## L-4: Large Numeric Literal

Large literal values multiples of 10000 can be replaced with scientific notation.Use `e` notation, for example: `1e18`, instead of its full numeric value.
